After performing sequence alignment between ACE2 cat, ACE2 human, and ACE2 mouse, the following findings were recorded:

Alignment score between ACE2 cat and ACE2 human: 3717
Percentage of identical amino acids: 85.21739130434783%
Alignment score between ACE2 cat and ACE2 mouse: 3592
Percentage of identical amino acids: 81.73913043478261%
Alignment score between ACE2 human and ACE2 mouse: 3579
Percentage of identical amino acids: 82.11180124223603%
Based on the alignment scores and percentage of identical amino acids, it can be concluded that ACE2 cat and ACE2 human are more closely related to each other than either is to ACE2 mouse.

From a biological and evolutionary standpoint, these findings suggest that ACE2 cat and ACE2 human may have a more recent common ancestor than either does with ACE2 mouse. It is also possible that there has been convergent evolution between ACE2 cat and ACE2 human, leading to their higher similarity. Further analysis and research would be necessary to fully understand the evolutionary implications of these findings.
